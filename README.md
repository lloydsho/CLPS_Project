# CLPS_Project

 You will need the latest version of Psychtoolbox, in order to utilize this project.
 I've committed the files for Psychtoolbox here, but you may have to download it through their website for it to function properly instead of the "Psychtoolbox" folder that is commited here.
 You will need to use the commandwindow and a monitor to engage with the stimuli.
 Please make sure everyfile I uploaded to the repository is in the path.
 The scripts that are the final product are 1)FinalStimuliPresentation 2)FinalWordPresentation 3)MasterGraphs
 Please ignore all of the other scripts and use these 3 scripts in order to engage with the project, all of the other scripts are not part of the submission. 
 Finally I will elaborate on how this projet is structered. Please execute FinalStiuliPresentation, FinalWordPresentation, and when those are completed, corresponding updates to the data for your trial will be   represented in teh MasterGraphs script which will presented consolidated values across values with graphs.
